Belle, is the only word I know that suits her well
When she dances oh, the stories she can tell
A free bird trying out her wings to fly away
And when I see her move I see the hell to pay

She dances naked in my soul and sleep won't come
And it's no use to pray this prayers to Notre Dame
Tell, who'd be the first to raise his hand and throw a stone
I'd hang him high and laugh to see him die alone
Oh Lucifer, please let me go beyond god's law
And run my fingers through her hair Esmeralda

Belle, there is a demon inside her who came from hell
And he turned my eyes from god, and oh, I fell
He put this heat inside me I'm ashamed to tell
Without my god inside I'm just a burning shell

The sin of Eve she has in her I know so well
For want of her I know I'd give my soul to sell
Belle, this gypsy girl is there a soul beneath her skin
And dies she bear the cross of all our human sin
Oh Notre-Dame please let me go beyond god's law
Open the door of love inside Esmeralda

Belle, even though her eyes seem to lead us to hell
She may be more pure more pure than the words can tell
But when she dances feelings come no man can quell
Beneath her rainbow coloured dress there burns the well

My promised one please let me one time be untrue
Before in front of god and man I marry you
Who'd be the man who'd turn from her to save his soul
To be with her I'd let the devil take me whole 
Oh, Fleur-De-Lys I am a man who knows no love
I go to open up the rose Esmeralda

She dances naked in my soul and sleep won't come
And it's no use to pray this prayers to Notre Dame
Tell, who'd be the first to raise his hand and throw a stone
I'd hang him high and laugh to see him die alone
Oh Lucifer,please let me go beyond god's law
And run my fingers through her hair Esmeralda
